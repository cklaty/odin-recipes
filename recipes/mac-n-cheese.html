    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Mac-n-Cheese makes for a great quick meal, with a little extra nutrition. This was a go to meal for the family growing up. Not sure who came up with it, but it stuck. Haven't had it for years, but am sure it would taste just as good today. Serves 4. 5 minute prep time, 15 minute cooking.</p>
